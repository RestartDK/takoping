    - Code cleaning @started(25-11-02 15:40)
    - Refactor to make custom hooks if needed
    - Fix context utilisation with prompts from project to make sure it only talks about the project you are currently on
    - Implement tool calls so that we can actually have a new diagram generated for the user, like the ai must determine when to do this action using a tool call and then make a new preset diagram
    - Implement better prompts throughout for citing and actually using tools
    - Create the feature where you can generate a new diagram and have the option to save it
    - Fix metadata for repositories to include description and stars
    - Add chat history
    - Define agent tool schema (focusNode, expandPath, openFileRange, createTour)
    - Try with normal rag to generate the diagrams, then experiment with agentic rag using this [framework](https://medium.com/@aydinKerem/ai-agents-design-patterns-explained-b3ac0433c915)
    - Experiment with multiple agent solutions, see which one performs best
    - Make docker compose to run the app with pg db, chroma, be, and fe
    - Create plan on how to generate the diagram for the whole repository (use github next example)
    - Attempt to deploy a llama reasoning model on aws
    - Attempt to deploy a retrieval nim on aws
    - Create custom implementation of retrieval nim for chromadb embeddings function
    ✔ Implement GitHub API repo scan with auth, rate limit handling @done(25-11-01 13:08)

  Client: 
    ✔ Initialize project and UI kit (vite, shadcn setup, Jotai store) @done(25-11-02 14:12)
    ✔ Implement treemap canvas with LoD zoom thresholds @done(25-11-02 14:12)
    ✔ Implement code viewer with file range highlighting and tabs @done(25-11-02 15:34)
    - Add tooltips, right-click menu, selection/highlight overlays
    - Build chat panel with "Take me there" executing agent tool calls
    - Persist diagram tabs/presets (filters, weighting)

  Deployment:
    - Manual deploy: EC2 for Bun, EC2 for Chromadb, SageMaker NIM endpoints
    - Wire DNS/SSL and env vars to AWS services
    - Terraform IaC: VPC, EC2, SG, IAM, SageMaker endpoints, DNS
    - Optional: CI/CD workflow to build/deploy backend/frontend

  Ops & Extras:
    - Add tracing/logging and minimal onboarding Q&A eval set
    - Add "Open in Cursor" action from answers/diagrams
    - Switch branch control in UI and data source
    - Use `Workers` from bun to handle jobs
